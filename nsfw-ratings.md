## The different levels of nsfw ratings on Theme Plaza
---
Theme Plaza has 3 levels of ratings, like how booru boards have. These ratings are safe, sketchy and NSFW. All Themes and Splashes go under one of these 3 ratings.

- Safe: 99% of all themes will go under this safe rating. Basically, if you can let your boss see it without getting in major trouble for pornagraphy, it's ok.
- Sketchy: This is the middleground between Safe and Sketchy. Examples of this types of themes include skimpy/small clothing, sexualised swimsuits and people showing a bit too much skin.
- NSFW: This is what you don't want your boss seeing at all. Examples include full nude people (but no lolis/shotas), sensitive body parts and basically pornagraphy.
